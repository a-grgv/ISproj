Made a concept picture based on the undated wireframes of the look and feel of the
App, to create this Google Material design guide was followed with the idea that windows
are represented to the user as paper cards floating on their screen and they sit on top of
each other. Windows have a shadow effect and a colours are a pastel or charcoal scheme. 
The login screen could follow this design also.  Pictures are made on photoshop so they 
be easy changed when needed.
