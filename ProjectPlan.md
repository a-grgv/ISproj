Iterate with wireframes, take pictures of each wireframe to log progress and note why the change was made on the paper.

By Week's End: List of Ideas to try and implement in code, with justification of changes


Week 2 - 31st-6th

TODO: Continue to iterate on design on finalised features, with a new version and justification each time.

By Week's End: Consider the technical side of both the base and what tech might be needed for new features.


Week 3 - 7th-13th

TODO: Begin Implementation Proper of both ends, if not already. Consider Js Libraries to get TextEditor up and running.
Investigate how to implement the new features, work in teams of 3/4 for front end and back.

By Weeks End: Start on the report , documenting the entire design process from early wireframes and group discussion to
considering technologies.Include goals for consumers, targets aimed to be met.


Week 4 - 14th-20th

TODO: Half team working on compiling the report, continue to add detail, make sure same concepts of HCI stated in introduction

Other half keep working on the implementation, try to get all basic features working well and start work on extra features.

By Week's End: Report should be all but finished, entering revision stages before submission on Monday. Pile on extra
hands here if needs help. Implementation should be done for basic texteditor features, begun on extra innovative features.


Week 5 - 21st-27th

Monday: Report Hand in

TODO: Finish implementation on all features that are possible to do so, reherse lab demonstration.

Thursday: Lab Demo
